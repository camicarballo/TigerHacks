With his brother, Bob, Harvey Weinstein cofounded movie production studio Miramax in 1979, specializing in indie films on shoestring budgets that won awards--and made money.

The duo sold the outfit to Disney in 1993 for $80 million, but continued to operate it, producing hits such as Pulp Fiction (1994), which grossed $213.9 million on an $8 million budget, and notching Best Picture Academy Awards for The English Patient (1997), Shakespeare In Love (1999) and Chicago (2002).

Weinstein’s ability to orchestrate Oscar nominations and translate them into wins resulted in a stunning 341 nominations and 81 Academy Awards for films the brothers produced or distributed, more than double the similarly-sized Lionsgate’s 122 nominations and 30 awards.
